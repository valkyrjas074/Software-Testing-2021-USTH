Exercise 1.1: What are some factors that would help a development organization move from Bezier’s testing level 2
(testing is to show errors) to testing level 4 (a mental discipline that increases quality)?

- Anticipate and foresee possibilities: the more prepared the software is, the more likely it is to have a logical structure and provide higher-quality results.
- Good architecture and design: a unified architecture and set of principles provides a stable foundation for software that saves time, effort, and money.
- Measurement of defects: treat the software as if it were a customer! Create software reports, if you're interested.
- Measurement of defects: treat the software as if it were a customer! Create software reports so you can identify faults and swiftly correct them!
- Effective unit tests: focus on the primary outputs, inputs, and tools. This provides additional time and power to testers.
