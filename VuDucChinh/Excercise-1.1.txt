1. What are some factors that would help a development organization
move from Beizer’s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to
testing level 4 (a mental discipline that increases quality)?



Answer:
To get to level 4 from level 2. Organization's tester and developer 
must both work together to reduce risk which mean they get to level
3.After that,once the testers and developers are on the same “team,” 
an organization can progress to real Level 4 testing. Having good 
technical people in testing.Another thing is that, organization need
to  eliminate faults as early as possible by testing.Having good 
leader ship.
