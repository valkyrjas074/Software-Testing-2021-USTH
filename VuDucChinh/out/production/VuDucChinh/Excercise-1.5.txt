a) In the finLast method the fault is in the for loop "i>0". To fix it
we write :for (int i = x.length-1; i >= 0; i--)

In the lastZero method the fault is in the for loop.To fix it we write
:for (int i=x.length-1; i >= 0; i--),because code is just code , there
are no ways of telling what is true or what is fault.

In the countPositive method, zero is not a positive number so the
correct code is: if(x>0){
			count++;
		}
In oddOrPos method the fault is in the if condition
to fix it, we code: 
	if(Math.abs(x[i]%2)==1 || x[i] > 0)

b) finLast all inputs start the loop, so if we use null input,a 
NullPointerException will be thrown.

lastZero all inputs start the loop, so all inputs execute the fault
even the null input its still return -1

countPositive if we let input be null or empty then we will get 0 
positive numbers counted so this test case doesn't execute the fault.

oddOrPos if we let input be null or empty then we will get 0 
positive numbers counted so this test case doesn't execute the fault.

c) finLast, let y != x[0] then this will not result in an error state

lastZero,if x is empty, there is no error

countPositive,any nonempty x that doesn't contain '0' in it.

oddOrPos,any nonempty x with only non-negative elements works

d) finLast,For this particular program, every input that results in 
error also results in failure. The reason is that error states are not
repairable by subsequent processing.

lastZero,All inputs with more than one '0' result in an error state.
So the input is every array with one '0'.

countPositive,For this particular program, every input that results in 
error also results in failure. The reason is that error states are not
repairable by subsequent processing.

oddOrPos,For this particular program, every input that results in 
error also results in failure. The reason is that error states are not
repairable by subsequent processing.

e) 
finLast
Input: x = [2, 3, 5]; y = 2;
Expected Output: 0
Actual Output: -1
First Error State:
x = [2, 3, 5]
y = 2;
i = 0 (or undefined or 1, depending on the compiler);
PC = just before return -1;


lastZero,The first error state is when index i has the value 0 when it
should have a value at the end of the array, namely x.length-1. 0 and 
x.length-1 are different unless x contains exactly one value. Hence, 
the first error state is encountered immediately after the 
initialization of i in the for-statement.

countPositive
Input: x = [-4, 2, 0, 2]
Expected Output: 2
Actual Output: 3
First Error State:
x = [-4, 2, 0, 2]
i = 2;
count = 1;
PC = right before the count++ statement.

oddOrPos
Input: x = [-3, -2, 0, 1, 4]
Expected Output: 3
Actual Output: 2
First Error State:
x = [-3, -2, 0, 1, 4]
i = 0;
count = 0;
PC = at end of if statement, instead of just before count++
