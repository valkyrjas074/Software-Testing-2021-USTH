## Scheduling Risk: Testing projects are not efficiently or completely scheduled to meet the deployment deadline. Inefficiency in scheduling can include:
 Inaccurate time estimates
Improper assessment of required tool resources
Improper assessment of required manpower resources
Unanticipated expansion(s) in project scope
Inaccurate identification of complexities, functionalities, or operations

## Budget Risk: Required investment is inaccurately anticipated, including:
Inaccurate Cost Estimation: Certain required items excluded from the estimation of costs
Cost Overruns: Unanticipated expenses, or inaccurate estimation, have cause unanticipated expenses
Expansion of the project scope: The project scope is expanded to include initially unanticipated expenses.

## Operational Risk: Ineffective processing, system failures, or unanticipated circumstances define operational risk. Causes include:
Failure to establish testing priorities
Conflicting test priorities
Insufficient resources
Improper training
Improper communication among team members
Improper communication with enterprise stakeholders

## Technical Risk: Technical risks often lead to functionality and performance failures. Some causes include:
Continually changing requirements
Lack of technical resources
Product complexities

## General Risk:
Changes in market strategies
Changes in government regulations
