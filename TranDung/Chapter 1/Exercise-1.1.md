Exercise 1.1

What are some factors that would help a development organization move from Beizerâ€™s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4 (a mental discipline that increases quality)?
    
From level 2 to level 3 testing, the purpose is not to show failure or absence anymore but to show the presence. We have to admit that whenever we use software, we expose some risk. The risk may be small and unimportant, or the risk may be great and the consequences catastrophic, but risk is always there. In level 3 testing, both testers and developers work together to reduce risk.
    
Once the testers and developers are on the same "team", an organization can progress to real Level 4 testing, which means that the purpose of testing is to improve the ability of the	developers to produce high quality software.
