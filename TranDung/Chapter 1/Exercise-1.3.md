Exercise 1.3	
What do we mean by “level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk? ” What
risk? Can we reduce the risk to zero?
    
There are many reasons why systems fail due to lack of testing, that's why the purpose of testing is to reduce risk in the future.
    
The risk maybe small and unimportant, or the risk maybe great and the consequences catastrophic. It may be ssome errors, some faults or some bugs.
    
We can't reduce the risk to zero because the risk is always there, we just don't notice it.
