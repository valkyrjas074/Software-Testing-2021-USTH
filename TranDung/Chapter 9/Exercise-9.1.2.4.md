Exercise 9.1.2.4
Consider the following BNF:

A ::= 0 B | 0 M | 0 B M
0 ::= "w" | "x" | "s" | "m"
B ::= "i" | "f" | "c" | "r"
M ::= "o" | "t" | "p" | "a" | "h"
	
(a) How many nonterminal symbols are in the grammar?
The nonterminal symbols are: A, 0, B and M.
	
(b) How many terminal symbols are in the grammar?
There are 13 terminal symbols: w, x, s, m, i, f, c, r, o, t, p, a and h.
	
(c) Write two strings that are valid according to the BNF.
String 1 is wrt and string 2 is mit.
	
(d) For each of your two strings, give two valid mutants of the string.
Two valid mutants are: wrp and mia.
	
(e) For each of your two strings, give two invalid mutants of the string.
Two valid mutants are: wrs and mif.
