Exercise 6.2.3
Write down all 16 tests to satisfy Multiple Base Choice coverage (MBCC) for the second categorization of triang()’s inputs in Table 6.2. Use the values in Table 6.3
	
There are 2 base tests: (2, 2, 2) and (1, 2, 2).
	
So for (2, 2, 2):
(0, 2, 2) (-1, 2, ,2) (2, 1, 2) (2, 0, 2) (2, -1, 2) (2, 2, 1) (2, 2, 0) (2, 2, -1)
	
For (1, 2, 2):
(0, 2, 2) (−1, 2, 2) (1, 1, 2) (1, 0, 2) (1, −1, 2) (1, 2, 1) (1, 2, 0) (1, 2, −1)
