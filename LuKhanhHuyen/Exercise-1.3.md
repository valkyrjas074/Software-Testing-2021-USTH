# Excercise 1.3 #
What do we mean by “level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk?”
* The purpose of testing is to know more faults therefore to reduce risk in the future.

What risk?
* They can be little damages such as bugs that can be fixed in a few minutes.
* Or the faults in software can cost you billions of dollars to repair.

Can we reduce the risk to zero?
* Never, since we can't aware of every cases but it's testers' job to find all the possible cases.
