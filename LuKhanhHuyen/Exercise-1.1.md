# Excercise 1.1 #
What are some factors that would help a development organization move from Beizer’s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4 (a mental discipline that increases quality)?

## The thinking ##
* The team has to understand that testing can show the presence, but not the absence of failures.
* Reducing risk is the ultimate goal of the project. Therefore, test engineers can become technical leaders of the project.

## The plan ##
* Primary responsibility to measure and improve software quality
* Testers and developers should cooperate to reduce risk
