# Excercise 2.2
If you have never worked for a software development company, which of the four test activities do you think you are best qualified for? (test design, automation, execution, evaluation)

I don't have much experience in testing but I have worked in my group projects and I think I best qualified for execution, since it doesn't require a lot of knowledge about testing.
